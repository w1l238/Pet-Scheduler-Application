# What's Left?

- [x] Implement fade animations of all pages when loading.
- [x] Confirm that all delete buttons use the modal instead of the browser popup (Should be one left in admin and one left in client).
- [x] Editing and saving client on admin account removes default ProfilePhotoURL. Likely tied to API call for modal save button which is taking ProfilePhotoURL and setting it back to ''.
- [x] Add check for each new requested appointment to ensure no double bookings.
- [x] Create documentation (using docusaurus).
- [x] Customize docusaurus. 
- [x] Admin favicon isn't showing. Only on client/home/login/register pages. On zen browser only for some reason? Chromium is fine.
- [x] Add editing option for pets in the admin's page.
- [x] Update documentation to reflect current implementation (specifically the api portion and schema).
- [x] Make sure docker compose builds project and works.
- [x] Git commit everything.
- [x] Deploy on server and host using my domain with cloudflare tunnels.
- [x] Write final report.
