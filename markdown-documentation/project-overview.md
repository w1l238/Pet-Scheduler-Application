# Project Overview

The Pet Scheduler Application is a full-stack web application designed to meet the needs of a small pet grooming or scheduling business. It provides a comprehensive information system that allows administrators to manage clients, pets, appointments, and services, while offering a user-friendly portal for clients to manage their own information and book appointments.

## Core Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the administrative tasks of a pet-centric business. By automating appointment reminders, centralizing records, and simplifying the booking process, the application aims to improve efficiency for the business owner and provide a convenient, modern experience for clients.

## Key Functionality

The application is split into two main user-facing sections:

### 1. Client Portal
A secure area where clients can:
*   Register and log in to their personal accounts.
*   Create and manage profiles for each of their pets, including uploading photos.
*   Request new appointments for their pets through an intuitive interface.
*   View all their past and upcoming appointments on a personal calendar or in a list.
*   Receive automated notifications about appointment status changes (e.g., approved, completed).

### 2. Admin Dashboard
A powerful backend interface for business owners/administrators to:
*   Manage all client accounts, with the ability to edit or delete users.
*   Oversee all pet profiles in the system.
*   Approve, deny, or complete incoming appointment requests.
*   View a master calendar of all scheduled appointments.
*   Define and manage the services offered by the business, including their price and duration.
*   Track finances through an automated invoicing system that generates invoices upon appointment completion.
*   Configure application-wide settings, such as business details, booking rules, and email templates.
*   Receive notifications for new appointment requests.
